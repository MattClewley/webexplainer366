      <h4>With Authenticity</h4>
      <p>A real internal version of one's self may not exist. The idea of what is considered authentic in a person might just be societies expectations for them. The idea of authenticity is informed by discourse, social norms, and cultural standards and practices.</p>
      <p>'Authenticity may be seen as an: “idealized representation of reality” [13]. Thus, a person is authentic if she 1) is what we expect her to be; 2) meets the standards for the culture and circumstances from which she comes; and, 3) puts on a creative and sincere performance of identity.' (Haimson & Hoffman, 2016).</p>
      <p>A prevalent problem with authenticity is it's inability for individuals to change. Change may be considered 'inauthentic' to others, while the individual considers it an aspect of growth instead.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="issue">
      <h4>With Facebook</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Real Name Policy</li>
        <p>Facebook has a ‘real name’ policy for social and financial reasons. While it makes sense, in practice, it comes up short. 
          Facebook's real name policy can flag non-western and Native American names. This can cause their accounts to be deactivated. While they can get their accounts reactivated, Facebook beauracracy is a mess and terrible experience for them to unlock their account again. Another issue with the real name policy is that it places groups like trans people and abuse survivors in a precarioius position because they remain vulnerable to exposure and harm.
        </p>

        <li>Idealization</li>
        <p>What is shown online, is not the most accurate representation of one's life, but what about their identity? Facebook demands authenticity yet at the same time, restricts certain people from authentic self-presentation. Authentic or idealized versions of oneselve are presented on Facebook. The idea of authenticity is informed by discourse, social norms, and cultural standards and practices. Therefore, we may only be seeing the aspects of someone they wish soceity to interpret as positive, instead of their true values or qualities.</p>

        <li>Static Authenticity</li>
        <p>Identities also change as a person ages, learns, and moves around in the world. 
        Many marginalized individuals with fluid or non-normative identities continue to struggle to represent themselves online.
        Facebook privileges users whose names, for whatever reason, remain relatively stable or static over time. This generates problems for those whose identities may need to change over time, as with a trans person undergoing gender transition or an abuse survivor trying to keep safe.
